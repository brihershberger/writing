## Hold the Tension

Hold the tension  
Between fire and flow  
Between edge and tide  

Let your fire light the path  
Let your water shape the way  

Burn with presence,  
not impatience  

Flow with intent,  
not excape  

Be like water—  
clear, quiet, unstoppable  
Be like flame—  
bright, honest, alive  

You are not either/or  
You are the forge and the flood  
The hand steady over flame  
The calm beneath the wave
